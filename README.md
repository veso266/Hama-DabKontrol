### Library + example
I wrote this back when I still had my Hama DIT2000M up on globaltuners, because there was lack of interest (people actually got confused) I pulled the plug and replace it with something much better: https://www.globaltuners.com/receiver/1351-Airspy-HF

that people actually use, so if you want to try it go ahead register on globaltuners.org and give it a go (you will like it)
